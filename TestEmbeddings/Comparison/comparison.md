|2|An inductive property of the central binomial coefficient.|A convenience function for `ReflectsColimit`, which takes the functor as an explicit argument to guide typeclass resolution.|
|3|The central binomial coefficient, `Nat.choose (2 * n) n`.|An enriched functor induces an honest functor of the underlying categories, by mapping the `(ùüô_ W)`-shaped morphisms.|
|4|`choose n 2` is the `n`-th triangle number.|Rpc function for the calc widget.|
|5|The sum of entries in a row of Pascal's triangle|Interpret a natural isomorphism of the underlying monoidal functors as an isomorphism of the braided monoidal functors.|
|6|Vandermonde's identity|The equivalence between `X` and the underlying type of its fundamental groupoid. This is useful for transferring constructions (instances, etc.) from `X` to `œÄ‚Çì X`.|
|7|proof that the `parts` sum to `n`|The functor `restrictedYoneda` is isomorphic to the identity functor when evaluated at the yoneda embedding.|
|8|`FloorSemiring.floor a` computes the greatest natural `n` such that `(n : Œ±) ‚â§ a`.|The category of types has `X √ó Y`, the usual cartesian product, as the binary product of `X` and `Y`.|
|9|The **binomial theorem**|Sending objects to cochain complexes supported at `0` then taking `0`-th homology is the same as doing nothing.|
|10|The `n`th central binomial coefficient is the product of its prime factors, which are at most `2n`.|Construct a bundled `CommGroup` from the underlying type and typeclass.|
