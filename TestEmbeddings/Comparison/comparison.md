|1|A sequence converges if every subsequence has a convergent subsequence.|If `A` is subterminal, the unique morphism from it to a terminal object is a monomorphism. The converse of `isSubterminal_of_mono_isTerminal_from`.|
|2|Monotone convergence theorem expressed with limits|`assert_exists n` is a user command that asserts that a declaration named `n` exists in the current import scope.  Be careful to use names (e.g. `Rat`) rather than notations (e.g. `ℚ`).|
|3|A Cauchy sequence on the natural numbers is bounded.|(Implementation detail). The function underlying `(A ⊗[R] Matrix n n R) →ₐ[R] Matrix n n A`, as an `R`-linear map.|
|4|The limit of a bounded-below subadditive sequence. The fact that the sequence indeed tends to this limit is given in `Subadditive.tendsto_lim`|Given a submodule, corestrict to the pairing on `M ⧸ W` by simultaneously restricting to `W.dualAnnihilator`.  See `Subspace.dualCopairing_nondegenerate`.|
|5|If a Cauchy sequence has a convergent subsequence, then it converges.|See `rank_subsingleton` for the reason that `Nontrivial R` is needed. Also see `rank_eq_zero_iff` for the version without `NoZeroSMulDivisor R M`.|
|6|Shows that the sequence of denominators is monotone, that is `Bₙ ≤ Bₙ₊₁`.|`a <\|> b` executes `a` and returns the result, unless it fails in which case it executes and returns `b`. Because `b` is not always executed, it is passed as a thunk so it can be forced only when needed. The meaning of this notation is type-dependent.|
|7|Assume that, for any `a < b`, a sequence can not be infinitely many times below `a` and above `b`. If it is also ultimately bounded above and below, then it has to converge. This even works if `a` and `b` are restricted to a dense subset.|`G.CliqueFree n` means that `G` has no `n`-cliques.|
|8|**Dirichlet's Test** for monotone sequences.|The rank of a module as a natural number.  Defined by convention to be `0` if the space has infinite rank.  For a vector space `M` over a field `R`, this is the same as the finite dimension of `M` over `R`.|
|9|A version of Bolzano-Weistrass: in a proper metric space (eg. $ℝ^n$), every bounded sequence has a converging subsequence.|At `-n` for `n ∈ ℕ`, the Gamma function is undefined; by convention we assign it the value `0`.|
|10|The monotone sequence whose value at `n` is the supremum of the `f m` where `m ≤ n`.|(Implementation detail). The function underlying `(A ⊗[R] Matrix n n R) →ₐ[R] Matrix n n A`, as an `R`-bilinear map.|
