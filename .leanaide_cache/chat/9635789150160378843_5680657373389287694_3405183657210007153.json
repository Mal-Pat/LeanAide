    "This statement involves a conjectural behavior of a function related to diophantine approximations. It might not directly translate to existing Lean libraries or straightforward Lean code due to its speculative nature. However, assuming you want a representation of the theorem in a hypothetical Lean setting, it could look something like this:\n\n```lean\ndef G (r : ℝ) : ℝ := Inf {abs (r - real.sqrt (m^2 + 2*n^2)) | m n : ℤ}\n\ntheorem tendsto_G_zero : Filter.Tendsto G Filter.atTop (nhds 0) :=\nsorry\n```\n\nNote: The above Lean code assumes the existence of certain mathematical constructs and theorems which might not be directly available or provable in Lean without substantial mathematical background and library support."},
